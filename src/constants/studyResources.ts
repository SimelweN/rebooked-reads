    content: `**Most students read textbooks wrong. Here's how to read like a top achiever.**

**BEFORE you start reading:**
• **Preview the chapter** - Read headings, subheadings, and summary first
• **Set a purpose** - What do you need to learn from this?
• **Check your knowledge** - What do you already know about this topic?
• **Time yourself** - How long will this take? Set realistic goals

**The SQ3R Method (proven for 70+ years):**

**1. SURVEY (2-3 minutes)**
• Read the chapter title and introduction
• Look at all headings and subheadings
• Read the summary or conclusion
• Look at pictures, graphs, and charts
• Get the "big picture" before diving in

**2. QUESTION (1-2 minutes)**
• Turn headings into questions
• "Photosynthesis" becomes "What is photosynthesis? How does it work?"
• Write down 3-5 questions you want answered
• This gives your brain something to search for while reading

**3. READ (actual reading time)**
• Read actively, not passively
• Look for answers to your questions
• Slow down at important parts
• Speed up through examples and stories
• Take notes in margins or separate paper

**4. RECITE (after each section)**
• Stop and summarize what you just read
• Say it out loud or write it down
• If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it yet
• Go back and re-read confusing parts

**5. REVIEW (5-10 minutes at the end)**
• Go through your notes and summaries
• Answer your original questions
• Connect new information to what you already knew
• Plan what you'll study next time`,

    content: `**Study for hours without burning out using this energy management system.**

**The 50/10 Rule:**
• Study for 50 minutes with intense focus
• Take a 10-minute break for recovery
• Repeat 3-4 times for a productive study session
• Take a longer 30-60 minute break after each cycle

**Why This Ratio Works:**
• 50 minutes is the average human attention span for complex tasks
• 10 minutes allows mental reset without losing momentum
• Prevents the decline in performance that starts after 45-60 minutes
• Maintains high energy throughout the day

**What to Do During Study Time:**
• Choose ONE subject or task per 50-minute block
• Remove all potential distractions
• Use active learning techniques (not passive reading)
• Keep water nearby to stay hydrated

**What to Do During Breaks:**
• Stand up and move around (fight sitting disease)
• Look out a window or go outside briefly
• Do light stretching or breathing exercises
• Avoid screens if possible (give your eyes a rest)
• Eat a healthy snack if needed

**Customizing for Your Needs:**
• Morning people: Start early with longer sessions
• Evening people: Adjust timing to your peak hours
• Difficult subjects: Use shorter 30/10 ratios
• Easy subjects: Try 60/15 ratios

**Energy Management Tips:**
• Study hardest subjects when energy is highest
• Use easier subjects as "breaks" between difficult ones
• Take a longer break if you feel mentally fatigued
• Stop studying when effectiveness drops below 70%`,

**Who Was Richard Feynman?**
• Nobel Prize-winning physicist
• Known for explaining complex topics simply
• Said "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough"
• Used this technique throughout his career

**The 4-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Choose a Concept**
• Pick one specific topic you're studying
• Write it at the top of a blank page
• Be specific (not "physics" but "how gravity works")

**Step 2: Teach It to a Child**
• Write an explanation as if teaching a 12-year-old
• Use simple words and avoid jargon
• Use analogies and examples from everyday life
• Make it clear and easy to understand

**Step 3: Identify Gaps**
• Notice where you get stuck or use complex words
• These are your knowledge gaps
• Mark these areas clearly
• Don't feel bad - this is the learning process!

**Step 4: Simplify and Analogize**
• Go back to your study materials for the gaps
• Learn the missing pieces
• Create simple analogies for complex ideas
• Rewrite your explanation even more simply

**Example Analogies:**
• DNA is like a recipe book for building humans
• Electric current is like water flowing through pipes
• Computer memory is like a filing cabinet
• Chemical bonds are like friendships between atoms

**Advanced Applications:**
• Record yourself explaining concepts
• Actually teach someone else
• Create simple diagrams to accompany explanations
• Use this for essay planning and presentations`,

**What is Interleaving?**
• Practicing different skills or topics in random order
• Opposite of "blocked practice" (doing the same thing repeatedly)
• Forces brain to actively choose the right approach
• Improves problem-solving and adaptability

**How Traditional Practice Fails:**
• Studying one topic for hours creates false confidence
• Brain gets comfortable with routine
• Doesn't prepare you for mixed exam questions
• Limited transfer to real-world situations

**How to Use Interleaving:**

**For Math and Sciences:**
• Mix different types of problems in each session
• Don't do 20 algebra problems in a row
• Instead: algebra, geometry, calculus, algebra, statistics, etc.
• Forces you to identify which method to use

**For Languages:**
• Mix vocabulary, grammar, and conversation practice
• Don't spend entire session on one grammar rule
• Alternate between reading, writing, speaking, listening
• Practice different tenses in random order

**For History and Social Studies:**
• Study different time periods in same session
• Compare and contrast different events/cultures
• Mix chronological and thematic approaches
• Connect patterns across different contexts

**Implementation Tips:**
• Start with blocked practice for new concepts
• Switch to interleaving once basics are understood
• Use different colors/folders for different topics
• Create mixed practice sets from textbook problems
• Review multiple subjects in each study session

**Why It's Harder (But Better):**
• Feels more difficult and confusing initially
• Progress seems slower compared to blocked practice
• Brain has to work harder to retrieve information

**Understanding Multiple Choice Questions:**
• Test specific knowledge and reasoning skills
• Often include distractors designed to confuse
• May test application, not just memorization
• Can be tricky even when you know the material

**Before Looking at Answers:**
• Read the question stem carefully
• Try to answer in your head first
• Look for key words: "best," "most," "except"
• Pay attention to qualifiers: "always," "never," "sometimes"

**Analyzing Answer Choices:**

**Elimination Strategy:**
• Cross out obviously wrong answers first
• Look for answers that are too extreme
• Eliminate answers with unfamiliar terms (unless certain)
• Be wary of answers with "always" or "never"

**Pattern Recognition:**
• Longer answers are often correct (but not always)
• Middle values in numerical answers are often right
• "All of the above" is correct more often than chance
• If two answers are similar, one is probably right

**Specific Question Types:**

**"Except" Questions:**
• Find the one answer that doesn't fit
• Rephrase as "Which is NOT true?"
• All other answers should be correct

**"Best Answer" Questions:**
• Multiple answers may be partially correct
• Look for the most complete or accurate answer
• Consider the context and scope of the question

**Application Questions:**
• Apply concepts to new situations
• Think about underlying principles
• Consider cause-and-effect relationships

**Time Management:**
• Budget time based on total questions
• Mark difficult questions and return later
• Don't spend too long on any single question
• Leave time for review at the end

**Guessing Strategy:**
• If no penalty, always guess rather than leave blank
• Use elimination to improve odds
• Trust your first instinct unless you find an error`,
